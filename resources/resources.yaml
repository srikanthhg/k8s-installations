# In this example, the resources field specifies both resource requests and limits for the my-container container. 
# The requests field specifies the minimum amount of resources that the container requires to run, while the limits field specifies the maximum amount of resources that the container can consume.

# For example, the requests.memory field specifies that the container requires at least 256 megabytes of memory, while the limits.cpu field specifies that the container can consume up to 500 milli-CPUs (half a CPU).
